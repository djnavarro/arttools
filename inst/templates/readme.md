# SERIESNAME

Source code for a generative art series:

- `source` contains source code for the generative art system
- `input` contains other input files used by the system (optional)
- `build` contains ancillary scripts that are not part of the art system (optional)

Folders that are used by the system but not included in the repository (and ignored by git):

- `output` contains raw output files generated directly by the system
- `SERIESNAME` contains manually curated versions of the output files, to be moved into cloud storage
