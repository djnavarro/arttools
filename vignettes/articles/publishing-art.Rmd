### Uploading curated images

- Optional, but desirable: move (or copy) the gallery folder to the `~/Bucket/djnavarro-art` folder. Gallery folders properly belong to the object store rather than the git repo, so we might as well have that reflected locally!
- To publish a gallery folder, copy it to the `djnavarro-art` bucket

  ```
  gcloud storage cp series-fake gs://djnavarro-art --recursive --project generative-art-389407
  ```
